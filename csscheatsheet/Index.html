    	<h1>About</h1>
    	<p> The company was registered in Ambawadi, Ahmedabad, Gujarat on 15 February 2007
          as Infotel Broadband Services Limited (IBSL). In June 2010, Reliance Industries (RIL)
          bought a 95% stake in IBSL for ₹4,800 crore (US$670 million). Although unlisted, IBSL
          was the only company that won broadband spectrum in all 22 circles in India in the 4G 
          auction that took place earlier that year. Later continuing as RIL's telecom subsidiary, 
          Infotel Broadband Services Limited was renamed as Reliance Jio Infocomm Limited (RJIL) 
          in January 2013.

          In June 2015, Jio announced that it would start its operations throughout the country
          by the end of 2015. However, four months later in October, the company postponed the 
          launch to the first quarter of the financial year 2016–2017.

          Later, in July 2015, a PIL filed in the Supreme Court by an NGO called the Centre for
          Public Interest Litigation, through Prashant Bhushan, challenged the grant of a
          pan-India licence to Jio by the Government of India. The PIL also alleged that the firm 
          was being allowed to provide voice telephony along with its 4G data service, by paying
          an additional fee of just ₹165.8 crore (US$23 million) which was arbitrary and unreasonable,
          and contributed to a loss of ₹2,284.2 crore (US$320 million) to the exchequer. The Indian
          Department of Telecommunications (DoT), however, explained that the rules for 3G and BWA 
          spectrum didn't restrict BWA winners from providing voice telephony. As a result, the PIL
          was revoked, and the accusations were dismissed.

          The 4G services were launched internally on 27 December 2015. The company commercially
          launched its 4G services on 5 September 2016, offering free data and voice services till
          31 December, which was later extended till 31 March 2017. Within the first month, Jio
          announced that it had acquired 1.6 crore (16 million) subscribers. Jio crossed 5 crore 
          (50 million) subscriber mark in 83 days since its launch, subsequently crossing 100 million
          subscribers on 22 February 2017. By October 2017 it had about 13 crore (130 million) subscriber</p>

    	<h3>Services</h3>
    	<p>The company launched its 4G broadband services throughout India in September 2016.
          It was slated to release in December 2015 after some reports said that the company was
          waiting to receive final permits from the government. Jio offers fourth-generation (4G)
          data and voice services, along with peripheral services like instant messaging and
          streaming movies and music.

          <h4>JioFiber</h4>
          <p>In August 2018, Jio began to test a new triple play fiber to the home service known tenatively
          as Jio GigaFiber, including broadband internet with speeds ranging from 100 to 1000 Mbit/s, as 
          well as television and landline telephone services.

          In August 2019, it was announced that the service would officially launch on 5 September 2019
          as JioFiber, in honour of the company's third anniversary. Jio also announced plans to offer
          streaming of films still in theatres ("First Day First Show") to eligible JioFiber subscribers.

          The company has a network of more than 250,000 km of fiber optic cables in the country, over which
          it will be partnering with local cable operators to get broader connectivity for its broadband services. 
          
          <h4>Jio Phone</h4>
          <p>JioPhone is a line of feature phones marketed by Jio. The first model, released in August 2017
          (with public pre-orders beginning 24 August 2017), was positioned as an "affordable" LTE-compatible
          feature phone. It runs the KaiOS platform (derived from the defunct Firefox OS), and includes a
          2.4-inch display, a dual-core processor, 4 GB of internal storage, near-field communication support,
          a suite of Jio-branded apps (including the voice assistant HelloJio), and a Jio-branded application
          store. It also supports a "TV cable" accessory for output to an external display.

          In July 2018, the company unveiled the JioPhone 2, an updated model in a keyboard bar form factor with
          a QWERTY keyboard and horizontal display. Jio also announced that Facebook, WhatsApp, and YouTube apps
          would become available for the two phones</p>
